how to connect from computer and run the setup_adsb.sh file


*************************************************************************************

Option A ‚Äî Copy from your Mac to the Pi (recommended)

Run this on your Mac (not on the Pi):

scp -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 /Users/frederic/Downloads/setup_adsb.sh lsgs@lsgs-01.local:~

Then SSH to the Pi and run it:

ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 lsgs@lsgs-02.local
chmod +x ~/setup_adsb.sh
sudo ~/setup_adsb.sh

# make the script executable
chmod +x ~/setup_adsb.sh

# run it with sudo, using the full path
sudo /home/lsgs/setup_adsb.sh

*************************************************************************************


CHECK IF ALL SYSTEM ARE RUNNING

sudo systemctl enable --now NetworkManager ModemManager systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl enable --now dump1090-fa adsb-collector adsb-uploader
sudo systemctl enable --now remoteit-health.timer net-failover.timer adsb-health.timer
# remoteit-refresh is a oneshot hook; we call it from the bootstrap script.





HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN IT"S COMPLETED?

When the script completes, it will display a message indicating that the setup is finished. You should see something like:Good question üëç.

Since setup_adsb.sh is a regular shell script, you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs running and when it has completed like this:

‚∏ª

1. While it‚Äôs running
	‚Ä¢	The script prints each command‚Äôs output in your terminal: package installs, systemctl enables, echo messages.
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôll see scrolling text such as:

[INFO] Installing dump1090-fa...
[OK] ADS-B collector service installed


	‚Ä¢	If it pauses for a while on apt-get install, that‚Äôs normal (downloading packages).

‚∏ª

2. When it finishes
	‚Ä¢	The script will stop printing and drop you back at the prompt:

lsgs@LSGS-01:~ $


	‚Ä¢	Often we add a final echo at the end of the script like:

echo "[SETUP COMPLETE] Reboot the Pi now with: sudo reboot"

If that‚Äôs in your version, you‚Äôll see that as the last line.

‚∏ª

3. Verify after completion

To make sure everything is installed and enabled, run:

# Check services
systemctl status dump1090-fa adsb-collector adsb-uploader --no-pager

# Check the bootstrap timer
systemctl status adsb-online-bootstrap.timer --no-pager

# Tail uploader log
tail -n 20 ~/Documents/adsb/logs/uploader.log

If you see those services active (running) and logs with ‚ÄúBOOTSTRAP tick‚Äù and S3 uploads, then the setup really finished properly.

‚∏ª

üëâ Do you want me to modify your setup_adsb.sh so that it always prints a big ‚ÄúSETUP COMPLETE‚Äù message at the end, so you‚Äôre never left wondering?
